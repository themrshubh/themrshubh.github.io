      Hello World, I'm Shubham Mankar
    </h2>
    <p class="p-3 p-md-5 fw-light fs-4">
      I am a happy kid working on things that I find cool with smart folks who do extraordinary things. 
      As an NC State graduate, I enjoy working on projects that help humankind progress, push boundaries, 
      and make life just a little bit easier. My past experiences have shaped me into the person 
      and developer I am today, and I am constantly looking for opportunities to learn and develop. 
      Finally, kindness, integrity, compassion, and determination are some values that I try my best to live by.
